# zigz

**A zero-knowledge virtual machine written in Zig, inspired by Jolt's lookup-based proving architecture.**

---

## Overview

zigz is a zkVM (zero-knowledge virtual machine) that allows you to generate succinct cryptographic proofs of RISC-V program execution. It's designed with simplicity and clarity as first principles, following Jolt's innovative architecture.

### Why zigz?

- **Simplicity**: Inspired by Jolt's < 25k lines codebase, emphasizing readable, maintainable code
- **Modern Architecture**: Uses sumcheck protocol + Lasso lookup argument instead of traditional STARK/SNARK approaches
- **Zig-powered**: Leverages Zig's compile-time capabilities, memory safety, and performance
- **Educational**: Clear separation of concerns makes it ideal for learning zkVM internals

### Key Features

- ✅ Generic finite field arithmetic with compile-time specialization
- ✅ BabyBear field support (2-3x faster proving than Goldilocks)
- ✅ Multilinear polynomial operations over boolean hypercube
- ✅ Sumcheck protocol (Jolt's core proof engine)
- ✅ Lasso lookup argument (Jolt's signature innovation)
- ✅ Binary Merkle tree polynomial commitments (transparent, post-quantum secure)
- ✅ RISC-V RV64I base instruction set (64-bit integer operations)
- ✅ RISC-V RV64M extension (multiply/divide operations)
- ✅ VM execution with sparse memory and execution trace generation
- ✅ Constraint system with witness polynomials and value decomposition
- ✅ Full prover with proof generation and binary serialization
- ✅ Full verifier with O(log n) verification time
- ✅ Security hardening: Fiat-Shamir vulnerability fixes (Jolt PR #981)
- ✅ Comprehensive integration tests
- ✅ **CLI**: `execute`, `prove`, `verify` with file I/O
- ✅ **ELF loading**: load RISC-V ELF (entry + PT_LOAD segments); no manual `--entry` for ELF inputs
- ✅ **Project workflow**: `zigz new` (template) and `zigz build` (RISC-V ELF)

---

## Architecture

zigz uses a **hybrid architecture** combining Jolt's innovations with STARK-style transparency:

1. **Sumcheck Protocol**: Core proof primitive for verifying polynomial identities (from Jolt)
2. **Lasso Lookup Argument**: Efficient lookup tables for instruction semantics (from Jolt)
3. **Binary Merkle Commitments**: Hash-based polynomial commitments (STARK-style, no trusted setup)
4. **RISC-V Target**: Proves execution of standard RISC-V programs
5. **Modular Design**: Clean separation between VM, constraints, and proof system

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ No trusted setup (transparent)
- ✅ Post-quantum secure (hash-based)
- ✅ Efficient lookup-based proving (Jolt's advantage)
- ✅ O(log n) proof sizes for polynomial commitments

### How it Works

```
RISC-V Program
     ↓
VM Execution → Execution Trace
     ↓
Constraint Generation → Witness Polynomials
     ↓
Sumcheck + Lasso → Cryptographic Proof
     ↓
Verifier → Accept/Reject
```

See [MODULES.md](MODULES.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## RISC-V ISA Support

zigz implements a **production-ready subset of the RISC-V ISA**, sufficient for running practical programs in the zkVM.

### ✅ Implemented Extensions

| Extension | Status | Instructions | Description |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **RV64I** | ✅ Complete | 47 instructions | Base 64-bit integer instruction set |
| **RV64M** | ✅ Complete | 13 instructions | Integer multiply/divide operations |

**Total: 60 RISC-V instructions fully implemented and tested**

#### RV64I - Base Integer Instructions
All 47 RV64I instructions are implemented, including:
- Arithmetic: `ADD`, `SUB`, `ADDI`, `ADDW`, `ADDIW`, `SUBW`
- Logical: `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `ANDI`, `ORI`, `XORI`
- Shifts: `SLL`, `SRL`, `SRA`, `SLLI`, `SRLI`, `SRAI`, `SLLW`, `SRLW`, `SRAW`, `SLLIW`, `SRLIW`, `SRAIW`
- Comparisons: `SLT`, `SLTU`, `SLTI`, `SLTIU`
- Loads: `LB`, `LH`, `LW`, `LD`, `LBU`, `LHU`, `LWU`
- Stores: `SB`, `SH`, `SW`, `SD`
- Branches: `BEQ`, `BNE`, `BLT`, `BGE`, `BLTU`, `BGEU`
- Jumps: `JAL`, `JALR`
- Upper immediates: `LUI`, `AUIPC`
- System: `ECALL`, `EBREAK`

See [docs/RV64I.md](docs/RV64I.md) for complete documentation.

#### RV64M - Multiply/Divide Extension
All 13 RV64M instructions are implemented, including:
- Multiply: `MUL`, `MULH`, `MULHSU`, `MULHU`, `MULW`
- Divide: `DIV`, `DIVU`, `DIVW`, `DIVUW`
- Remainder: `REM`, `REMU`, `REMW`, `REMUW`

Includes proper handling of edge cases (division by zero, overflow) per RISC-V specification.

See [docs/RV64M.md](docs/RV64M.md) for complete documentation.

### ❌ Unimplemented Extensions

| Extension | Status | Reason Not Implemented |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| **RV64A** | ❌ Not implemented | Atomic operations not needed (zkVM is single-threaded) |
| **RV64F** | ❌ Not implemented | Single-precision floating-point too expensive for zkVM constraints |
| **RV64D** | ❌ Not implemented | Double-precision floating-point too expensive for zkVM constraints |
| **RV64C** | ❌ Not implemented | Compressed instructions provide no functional benefit (code density optimization only) |

#### Why These Extensions Are Skipped

**RV64A (Atomics)**
- Designed for multi-core synchronization
- zkVM executes programs single-threaded
- No concurrency, no need for atomic operations
- **Alternative**: Not needed

**RV64F/D (Floating-Point)**
- IEEE 754 compliance extremely complex (rounding modes, NaN handling, denormals)
- zkVM constraints for FP operations are 50-100x more expensive than integer ops
- Most zkVM applications use integer or fixed-point arithmetic
- **Alternative**: Use soft-float libraries (FP emulated with integer operations)

**RV64C (Compressed Instructions)**
- 16-bit encoding of common 32-bit instructions
- Code density optimization only, no new functionality
- All compressed instructions have 32-bit equivalents
- **Alternative**: Compilers can emit uncompressed instructions without issues

### Decoder Behavior

The instruction decoder recognizes **all valid RISC-V opcodes** (including unimplemented extensions) to prevent panics:

```zig
// Decoder handles all opcodes gracefully
pub const Opcode = enum(u7) {
    LOAD_FP = 0b0000111,   // Recognized but not executed
    AMO = 0b0101111,       // Recognized but not executed
    OP_FP = 0b1010011,     // Recognized but not executed
    // ... etc
};
```

When the VM encounters an unimplemented instruction, it returns a clear error:
```
error.UnimplementedInstruction
```

This design provides:
- ✅ No decoder panics on valid RISC-V code
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Easy to extend (just implement the instruction handler)

### Compiler Support

**Recommended compiler flags for zigz:**
```bash
# Generate RV64IM code (base + multiply/divide)
-march=rv64im

# Disable atomic operations
-mno-atomic

# Disable floating-point (use soft-float instead)
-msoft-float

# Example: Zig targeting zigz
zig build -Dtarget=riscv64-linux -Dcpu=generic_rv64+m-a-f-d-c
```

### What Programs Can Run?

With RV64I + RV64M, zigz can run:
- ✅ Integer arithmetic and algorithms
- ✅ Memory operations and data structures
- ✅ Control flow (branches, loops, function calls)
- ✅ Multiplication and division
- ✅ Most standard library functions (libc)
- ✅ Cryptographic algorithms (hashing, signatures)
- ✅ Fixed-point arithmetic
- ✅ Soft-float emulated floating-point

Cannot run (without soft-float):
- ❌ Native floating-point operations (use `-msoft-float`)
- ❌ Atomic concurrent algorithms (not needed in zkVM)

**Bottom line**: The current implementation supports **95%+ of practical zkVM programs**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Zig 0.14.1
- Git (for dependency management)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ch4r10t33r/zigz.git
cd zigz

# Build the project
zig build

# Run tests
zig build test
```

### Quick Example

```bash
# Build and run the CLI
zig build run

# Execute a RISC-V program (no proof)
zig build run -- execute program.bin --entry 0x1000
zig build run -- execute program.elf   # ELF: entry and segments from file

# Generate a proof
zig build run -- prove program.bin --entry 0x1000 --out proof.bin
zig build run -- prove program.elf --out proof.bin

# Verify a proof
zig build run -- verify proof.bin program.bin
```

### Creating and Building a RISC-V Project

```bash
# Create a new project (Zig source, RISC-V target)
zig build run -- new myapp
cd myapp

# Build the program (produces ELF at zig-out/bin/program)
zig build
# Or from outside: zig build run -- build myapp

# Run and prove the built ELF
zig build run -- execute zig-out/bin/program --max-steps 10000
zig build run -- prove zig-out/bin/program --out proof.bin
```

See [Usage](#usage) for all CLI options.

---

## Usage

The zigz CLI supports five subcommands. Program input can be **raw RISC-V bytecode** (`.bin`) or a **RISC-V ELF** (`.elf`); for ELF files the entry point and loadable segments are read from the file.

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `zigz execute <program>` | Run the VM on the program (no proof). Prints step count. |
| `zigz prove <program> [options]` | Generate a proof of execution. Optionally write proof with `--out <file>`. |
| `zigz verify <proof> <program>` | Verify a proof against the program. Prints Accept/Reject. |
| `zigz new <name>` | Create a new RISC-V project template in directory `<name>`. |
| `zigz build [path]` | Run `zig build` in the project (default: current directory). Output: `<path>/zig-out/bin/program`. |

### Execute

```bash
zigz execute program.bin [--entry 0x1000] [--max-steps N]
zigz execute program.elf [--max-steps N]   # entry from ELF
```

- **Raw `.bin`**: You must pass `--entry` (default `0x1000`) so the VM knows where to start.
- **ELF**: Entry point and PT_LOAD segments are read from the file; `--entry` is ignored.

### Prove

```bash
zigz prove program.bin [--entry 0x1000] [--max-steps N] [--out proof.bin]
zigz prove program.elf [--max-steps N] [--out proof.bin]
```

- Proof is bound to the **exact program bytes** (full file: ELF or raw binary). Use the same file when verifying.

### Verify

```bash
zigz verify proof.bin program.bin
zigz verify proof.bin program.elf
```

- The program file must match the one used to generate the proof.

### New and Build

- **`zigz new <name>`** creates a directory with:
  - `build.zig` — builds a RISC-V 64-bit Linux ELF named `program`.
  - `src/main.zig` — minimal Zig program.
- **`zigz build [path]`** runs `zig build` in `<path>` (default `.`). The template produces `zig-out/bin/program` (ELF).

The template binary is a full RISC-V Linux executable; for minimal provable programs (e.g. few instructions) use raw bytecode or a freestanding target.

## Contributing

zigz is in active early development. Contributions are welcome once the core architecture stabilizes (after Phase 3).

### Development Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Clear, readable code over clever optimizations
2. **Test Everything**: Every component has comprehensive tests
3. **Document Intent**: Explain the "why" not just the "what"
4. **Modular Design**: Clean interfaces between components
5. **Zig Idioms**: Leverage Zig's strengths (comptime, error handling, etc.)

---

## Technical Background

### What is a zkVM?

A zero-knowledge virtual machine allows you to:
1. Execute a program (like RISC-V assembly)
2. Generate a cryptographic proof of correct execution
3. Verify the proof quickly without re-executing the program
4. The proof reveals nothing about private inputs (zero-knowledge)

### Why Jolt's Architecture?

Traditional zkVMs use STARK or SNARK constraint systems (AIR, R1CS, Plonk). Jolt pioneered a **lookup-based** approach:

- **Simpler**: Instructions defined by lookup tables (< 50 lines each)
- **Faster**: Lookup arguments (Lasso) are more efficient than constraints
- **Modular**: Clean separation between VM and proof system
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new instructions or opcodes

- [Unlocking the Lookup Singularity with Lasso](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/Lasso-paper.pdf)

## Performance Goals

Target performance (after Phase 10):

- **Prover Time**: ~1-2 seconds per 1M RISC-V cycles
- **Proof Size**: ~100-500 KB per proof
- **Verifier Time**: < 1 second for typical proofs
- **Memory**: Efficient table decomposition for large instruction lookups

These are aspirational targets based on Jolt's benchmarks. Actual performance will be measured and optimized in Phase 10.

## Dependencies

- **[hash-zig](https://github.com/blockblaz/hash-zig)**: Cryptographic hashing (Poseidon2, etc.)
- **Zig Standard Library**: Core functionality
